## Noted Base

This code repository was created for the [AWS for Front-End Engineers (ft. S3, Cloudfront & Route 53) Course](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/aws-frontend-react/) for Frontend Masters.

I learnt how to deploy using AWS S3 and Cloudfront. I usuallly like to have a faint idea of everything I am dealing with, even though, it's not my primary responsibility. There was always this S3 shaped hole in my understanding while doing frontend stuff for work. I am glad to have filled it a bit.
